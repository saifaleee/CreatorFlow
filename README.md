# CreatorFlow Project

CreatorFlow is a YouTube content management platform designed to help creators organize and streamline their video production process using a Trello-like interface.

## Project Structure

This project consists of two main repositories that work together:

1. [**CreatorFlow Landing Page**](https://github.com/saifaleee/CreatorFlow-Landing-Page) - A modern, responsive landing page that introduces users to the platform's features and benefits.

2. [**YT-Trello Application**](https://github.com/saifaleee/YT-Trello) - The main application, featuring a Trello-like interface tailored specifically for YouTube content creators.

## How They Connect

The two applications work together to provide a complete user experience:

1. Users discover CreatorFlow through the landing page
2. "Get Started" and navigation buttons on the landing page redirect to the main application
3. Authentication happens in the main application
4. Users can navigate back to the landing page from the main application
